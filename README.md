# Statistics with Python - MAT243

This repository contains my coursework and projects for **MAT243: Applied Statistics for STEM**.

---

## Course Overview

MAT243 explores the application of statistical inferential techniques in STEM fields. The course emphasizes problem-solving through programming, enabling students to analyze and interpret data effectively.

Key topics include:

- Probability distributions  
- Sampling distributions  
- Estimation methods  
- Hypothesis testing  
- Linear regression analysis

## Tools & Technologies

Throughout the course, I use various tools to implement statistical techniques, including but not limited to:

- **Python** – primary programming language for data analysis and scripting  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – interactive coding and visualization  
- **matplotlib.pyplot** – for creating plots and visualizations  
- **Codio** – an online platform used for course activities and assignments

*Additional tools and libraries will be added as the course progresses.*
