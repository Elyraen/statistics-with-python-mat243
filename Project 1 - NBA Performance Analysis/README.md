# NBA Performance Analysis: Warriors (2013–2015) vs Bulls (1996–1998)

This project was completed for a university statistics course, where I worked as a data analyst to compare the scoring performance and consistency of two NBA teams across different eras. Using historical data and Python-based analysis, I applied descriptive statistics, data visualization, and confidence intervals to uncover key insights about team performance.

## 📊 Project Overview

### 🏀 Teams Compared

- **Golden State Warriors** (2013–2015) – *My selected team*
- **Chicago Bulls** (1996–1998) – *Assigned comparison team*

### 🧪 Analysis Techniques Used

- Histograms to visualize point distributions
- Side-by-side boxplots to compare central tendency and variability
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, standard deviation)
- Confidence intervals to estimate population skill levels

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Both teams showed **roughly normal distributions** in scoring, with the Warriors having a slightly higher **mean (110.1)** and tighter **standard deviation (11.1)** compared to the Bulls.
- **Boxplots** revealed the Warriors had a higher median score and more consistent high-scoring games than the Bulls.
- The **95% confidence interval** for team skill (Elo rating) was:
  - **Warriors (2013–2015):** (1502.02, 1507.18)
  - **Bulls (1996–1998):** (1487.66, 1493.65)
- This suggests that during their respective periods, the Warriors played in a more competitive environment with higher overall skill ratings.

## 🎯 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how statistical analysis can be used to evaluate team performance across different NBA eras. The Warriors had higher average scoring, tighter consistency, and operated in a more competitive environment than the Bulls of the late 90s. These insights can help inform coaching decisions, strategic planning, and player development in professional sports.
